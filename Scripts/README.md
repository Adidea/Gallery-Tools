## Scripts
Various scripts in various stages of usability built around parsing the json generated by the Gallery Scraper.

# What they do

- ExifJSON: converts json to a format compatible with ExifTool
- FindArtistsNotWatched: finds artists whos artwork has been favorited, but aren't on your watch list.
- fixFileNames: fixes improperly encoded unicode filenames produced in older versions of the scraper.
- GetSubmissionIages: outputs a text file with image urls to be used with a download manager.
- removeDuplicatedFromFileList: removes duplicate entries. I believe I used this after pasting together multiple json files with overlapping data.
